# Initialization

In many situations, we need to initialize the application (i.e perform certain actions) before listening to incoming HTTP requests. This is the case, for example, if you need to establish a connection to the database.

There are three ways to achieve this in FoalTS.

## The `main` function

The most straightforward way to do it, which is used by default, is to add the initialization commands in the `main` function before `createApp` is called.

If your application uses TypeORM, your project should have a file `src/index.ts` that looks like this:

```typescript
async function main() {
  // Initialization
  await createConnection();

  // Creation of the application
  const app = createApp(AppController);

  // ...
}

main();
```

## The `AppController.init` method

Sometimes, however, this approach is not sufficient because we need to call the methods of some services. In this case, you can add an `init` method to the root controller class which will be called before the application is fully created. This method can be synchronous or asynchronous.

*Example 1*
```typescript
export class AppController {

  @dependency
  serviceA: ServiceA;

  async init() {
    await this.serviceA.doSomething();
  }

}
```

*Example 2*
```typescript
export class AppController {

  @dependency
  serviceA: ServiceA;

  @dependency
  serviceB: ServiceB;

  async init() {
    this.serviceA.init();
    this.serviceB.init();
  }

}
```

For this to work, you need to update your `src/index.ts` file and create the application with the asynchronous function `createAndInitApp`.

```typescript
import { createAndInitApp } from '@foal/core';

async function main() {
  const app = await createAndInitApp(AppController);

  // ...
}

main();
```

## The services `boot` method

> `boot` methods are available in v1.8.0 onwards.

Alternatively you can add a `boot` method in your services. This method can be synchronous or asynchronous.

*Example*
```typescript
export class ServiceA {

  async boot() {
    await doSomething();
  }

}
```

Then, you have to call the `boot` method of your service manager (it will be automatically called starting from version 2).

```typescript
import { createAndInitApp } from '@foal/core';

async function main() {
  const serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
  const app = createApp(AppController, {
    serviceManager
  });
  // This line calls the `boot` method of all your services that have one.
  await serviceManager.boot();

  // ...
}

main();
```

If you manually inject services to your service manager and you want their `boot` methods to be called, you must specify this in the `set` method options.

```typescript
const serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
serviceManager.set(ServiceA, myServiceInstance, { boot: true })
```

## Best Practices

If your initialization consists of several asynchronous tasks, you may want to perform them in *parallel*. This will reduce the initialization time, which has an impact if you use a serverless architecture.

```typescript
export class AppController {

  async init() {
    // Don't do
    await createConnection();
    await createAnotherConnection();

    // Do
    await Promise.all([
      createConnection(),
      createAnotherConnection()
    ])
  }

}
```
