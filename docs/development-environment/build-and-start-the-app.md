## Build and Start the App

> You are reading the documentation for version 2 of FoalTS. The documentation for version 1 can be found [here](#). To migrate to version 2, follow [this guide](../upgrade-to-v2/index.md).

FoalTS provides several commands to help you build and develop your app.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run develop` | Build the source code and start the server. If a file changes then the code is rebuilt and the server reloads. This is usually **the only command that you need during development** |
| `npm run build` | Build the app code located in the `src/` directory (test files are ignored). |
| `npm run start` | Start the server from the built files. |
