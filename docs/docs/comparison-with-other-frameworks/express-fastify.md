title: Foal vs Express or Fastify
sidebar_label: Express / Fastify
---

These pages are definitely the most difficult to write in this guide. If you are here, it is probably because you want to know if you should choose Foal over another framework. There are many in the Node ecosystem and choosing one is not always an easy task. These pages are meant to help you on your way.

Of course, we prefer FoalTS because we sincerely believe that it solves a number of problems better than other existing frameworks. And so we may have some bias. However, we will try in these pages to be as objective and sincere as possible to show you the differences between FoalTS and other frameworks.

In addition, we would also recommend that you download and test them yourself. You'll be able to make your own opinion about each of them and choose the one that suits you best. FoalTS *get-started* tutorial can be found [here](../tutorials/simple-todo-list/1-installation.md).

## Comparison Overview

### Express and Fastify are Minimalist

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) are all low-level frameworks that mainly take care of routing requests, handling errors, and parsing cookies, URLs, headers and bodies. They present themselves as *fast*, *minimalist* and *low overhead* and are not intented to be provided with a complete environment (CLI, ORM, auth, access control, test tools, etc). Many high-level frameworks use them as underlay for their core, which is the case of FoalTS.
