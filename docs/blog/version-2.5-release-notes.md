Version 2.5 of Foal has been released! Here are the improvements that it brings.

<!--truncate-->

## `npm run develop` watches config files

In previous versions of Foal, the `develop` command did not restart the server when a configuration file was changed. This was annoying and is the reason why, starting with v2.5, new projects generated by the CLI will watch configuration files.

## File size available after upload

When uploading and validating files with the hook `@ValidateMultipartFormDataBody`, the `File` objects returned by the hooks now have a new a property `size`.


```typescript
import { Context, Post, HttpResponseOK } from '@foal/core';
import { ValidateMultipartFormDataBody } from '@foal/storage';

export class UserController {

  @Post('/profile')
  @ValidateMultipartFormDataBody({
    files: {
      profile: { required: true, saveTo: 'images/profiles' }
    }
  })
  uploadProfilePhoto(ctx: Context) {
    const { path, size } = ctx.request.body.files.profile;
    console.log(path);
    // images/profiles/GxunLNJu3RXI9l7C7cQlBvXFQ+iqdxSRJmsR4TU+0Fo=.png
    console.log(size);
    // a number
    return new HttpResponseOK();
  }

}
```
